## Bayesian Thought Experiment

There are two foundational elements in a Bayesian Analysis:

1. Bayesian inference is a re-allocation of credibility across possibilities
2. These possibilities are parameter values in meaningful mathematical models

### Guess Who Exercise
Consider the game Guess Who, where the goal is to ask questions to identify an opposing player's character.

\pagebreak

- Given the line up of suspects above, draw you belief (as a probability) for each character. Note these should sum to one and constitute the first foundation element in Bayesian Analysis. 

- The first set of probabilities are known as *prior* probabilities.

```{r echo=FALSE}
players <- c('Megan','Donna','Clark','Ally','Grace','Wyatt')
label <- 1:6
prob <- rep(1/6,6)
plot(label,prob, type='h', axes=F, ylab='Probability', xlab='Character', ylim=c(0,1), lwd=8)
box()
axis(1, labels = players, at = 1:6)
axis(2)
```

> - **Your adversary**: Yes

```{r echo=FALSE}
players <- c('Megan','Donna','Clark','Ally','Grace','Wyatt')
label <- 1:6
prob <- c(0,1/3,0,1/3,1/3,0)
plot(label,prob, type='h', axes=F, ylab='Probability', xlab='Character', ylim=c(0,1), lwd=8)
box()
axis(1, labels = players, at = 1:6)
axis(2)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
players <- c('Megan','Donna','Clark','Ally','Grace','Wyatt')
label <- 1:6
prob <- c(0,1/2,0,1/2,0,0)
plot(label,prob, type='h', axes=F, ylab='Probability', xlab='Character', ylim=c(0,1), lwd=8)
box()
axis(1, labels = players, at = 1:6)
axis(2)

box()
axis(1, labels = players, at = 1:6)
axis(2)

### Ex. Rolling a Die
Now consider a similar example using a die. Suppose our goal is to determine the probability of the die landing on 6. Now constuct your prior belief for this die. 

Note this is different from the previous example. 

- We are now interested in estimating the probability of rolling a 6, rather than if the character is one of 6 possibilities.
- We are still thinking in a distribution, so the total probability (or credibility) should be allocated across the set of possible values.


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='200px', fig.align='center'}
label <- 1:6
prob <- c(0,1/2,0,1/2,0,0)
plot(label,prob, type='n', axes=F, ylab='', xlab='Probability of Rolling a 6', ylim=c(0,1), lwd=8)
box()
axis(1, labels = c(0,.25,.50,.75,1), at = seq(1,6,length.out=5))
```
 \vfill
 

Suppose we observe three rolls, now update your beliefs.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='200px', fig.align='center'}
label <- 1:6
prob <- c(0,1/2,0,1/2,0,0)
plot(label,prob, type='n', axes=F, ylab='', xlab='Probability of Rolling a 6', ylim=c(0,1), lwd=8)
box()
axis(1, labels = c(0,.25,.50,.75,1), at = seq(1,6,length.out=5))
```
\vfill

Finally suppose we observe 100 more rolls, now update your beliefs.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='200px', fig.align='center'}
label <- 1:6
prob <- c(0,1/2,0,1/2,0,0)
plot(label,prob, type='n', axes=F, ylab='', xlab='Probability of Rolling a 6', ylim=c(0,1), lwd=8)
box()
axis(1, labels = c(0,.25,.50,.75,1), at = seq(1,6,length.out=5))
```

### Key Points From This Activity

- *Thinking with distributions:*
A key philosophical idea of Bayesian statistics focuses on uncertainty and thinking about the complete set of possibilities and their associated probabilities. This idea of thinking with a distribution explicitly be seen in the Guess Who example. Furthermore, this idea will enable probabilistic computations such as "What is the probability that the opponents character is wearing a hat?"


- *Specifying a prior distribution:*
The starting point for any Bayesian analysis is a prior distribution. Some general principles for prior distributions are to put positive probability on any plausible set and to avoid imparting too much information with a prior distribution.

- *Update distribution with additional data or evidence:*
Given a prior distribution and additional information (such as the opponent's character is wearing a hat), we can update our prior distribution. This updated distribution is known as a posterior distribution. This process can continue sequentially as more and more information is included, the posterior distribution updates accordingly.
